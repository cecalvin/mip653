## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to geographic information systems (GIS) and to the use of spatial methods for analyzing and designing urban spaces. 

Maps and geographic analysis are key tools for interpreting the built environment and the social conditions it contains. GIS methods allow for the analysis of geographic features together with attributes (environmental, social, demographic, political) of those places. 

The thoughtful use of spatial data can reveal previously unseen patterns, changing the way we see our world. Map-based approaches can transform the understanding of initial site conditions. However maps are never *just* representations, they are nearly always active agents in shaping the worlds they describe. Geographic analysis can define the baseline of what is considered or excluded – and when used by urban planners and designers, what is possible and what is not possible. 

This course engages with this agency of maps directly in hands-on workshops covering the technical skills required to use maps as both tools for research and design-based interventions. Likewise the course will focus throughout on fostering a deep understanding of the promises, as well as the limitations of GIS-based methods.
