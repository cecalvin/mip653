## Course description
This course provides an introduction to geographic information systems (GIS) and to the use of spatial methods for analyzing and designing urban spaces. 

Maps and geographic analysis are key tools for interpreting the built environment and the social conditions it contains. GIS methods allow for the analysis of geographic features together with attributes (environmental, social, demographic, political) of those places. 

The thoughtful use of spatial data can reveal previously unseen patterns, changing the way we see our world. Map-based approaches can transform the understanding of initial site conditions. However maps are never *just* representations, they are nearly always active agents in shaping the worlds they describe. Geographic analysis can define the baseline of what is considered or excluded – and when used by urban planners and designers, what is possible and what is not possible. 

This course engages with this agency of maps directly in hands-on workshops covering the technical skills required to use maps as both tools for research and design-based interventions. Likewise the course will focus throughout on fostering a deep understanding of the promises, as well as the limitations of GIS-based methods. 

### Course structure 
The course syllabus will be divided into four major sections addressing key geographic concepts:  

Mapping where things are  
Mapping values and categories    
Mapping overlaps, intersections, and paths    
Mapping proximity and concentration

The final weeks of class will be dedicated to synthesizing methods and topics covered towards the development of the final project. 

Each section will consist of lectures on the geographic concepts under consideration, discussions of readings and example projects/maps, and skills-focused workshops. After each workshop students will complete weekly (or biweekly) mapping assignments requiring increasingly independent work leading towards the final project.

### Thematic/geographic focus
The course will focus on current equitable development goals in Newark. Using the Newark Forward plan as a guide, the skills based mapping assignments will use datasets with relevance to issues addressed in the plan. Students will be asked to develop a final project that uses the plan as a starting point to define a research or advocacy project focused on Newark. 

### Learning objectives
After completing this course students will:

-  have developed basic proficiency in the use of desktop GIS software for mapping urban environments
-  understand cartographic conventions and use them in designed map-based drawings
-  be able to discuss the role of mapping in the design process, its imposed biases, and have a nuanced understanding of the ethical considerations of data-driven work
-  understand how to incorporate GIS into design-based workflows (including Adobe Creative Suite & Rhino) 
-  have developed familiarity with core analytical processes in GIS including: 
-  Geometric operations
-  Overlay operations
-  Measuring densities, and concentrations
- Defining contextually appropriate understandings of proximity

## Course requirements

Participation in class discussion and workshops, including map presentations (20%)  
Completion of weekly skills-focused mapping assignments (40%)  
Final project (40%)  
    Proposal (10%)  
    Methodology (15%)  
    Final presentation and report or atlas (25%)  

<!-- The grading scale for the course will be: A = 90-100%; B+ =85-89; B = 80-84; C+ = 75-79; C=65-75.
 -->

### Class participation
Each week students will post two questions related to the week's readings to the discussion board on Canvas by 10pm on Tuesday. When developing questions students should consider connections between multiple texts (either from the current week or prior weeks). The questions should refer to specific parts of the reading (for example through quotation). 

In addition, students will sign up after the first week of classes to bring a map example to class discussion once over the course of the semester. Students will upload an image or link to a map (or atlas) that they wish to discuss with the class, and will then present what they find interesting, intriguing, noteworthy about the map in a 5 minute presentation during class. 
The examples presented over the course of the semester will contribute to a shared class resources of visual and thematic precedents. 

### Mapping assignments
There will be four critical skills-focused mapping assignments over the course of the semester. These will provide additional instruction beyond in-class lectures and discussions and will focus on the technical application of concepts in spatial representation and analysis in a GIS software environment. 

There will often be multiple deliverables for each assignment, students should take care to submit all deliverables in the formats specified in the assignment. Failing to do so may result in a lower assignment score.

The assignments will require increasingly independent work and design over the course of the semester. They will be evaluated on completion, accuracy, and later in the semester on the thoughtfulness with which students apply the spatial concepts and the care with which students design map-based deliverables. A rubric for assessment will be provided along with the first assignment. 

Students are required to complete each by the deadlines specified in the assignments, falling behind will in all likelihood result in confusion or difficulty in class. 

### Final project 
Over the second half of the semester students will develop a final project that uses mapping to support or research some aspect of the Newark Forward plan. Students will be asked to focus in particular on the plan’s consideration of Housing, Environmental Sustainability, and Inclusive Development. A detailed assignment will be distributed midway through the semester. 

Broadly, students will devise a project of their own interest that may either be research-focused (answering a specific spatial research question for which the answer is not known) or narrative-driven (telling a story about a place/set of conditions to a particular audience). A list of topics will be distributed that can serve as possible starting points, and might include:  

- Environmental Sustainability  
    -  What Newark neighborhoods have the least access to green spaces?
    -  Identify and advocate for the conversion of multiple vacant properties into open space   

- Housing 
    -  What are the spatial patterns of vacant properties in Newark?

- Inclusive Development
    -  Develop a typology of Newark’s corridors to guide the selection of priority sites for investment

The project will require students to develop a proposal, design a methodology, and produce final outputs (taking the form of either a narrative atlas or a graphic research report). Final presentations will be held at the end of the semester. 

### Backups
Students are expected to regularly backup and save their work. Loss of work due to computer malfunction is not a sufficient excuse for late  assignments. 

### Expectation of Academic Honesty
Academic Integrity is the cornerstone of higher education and is central to the ideals of this course and the university. Cheating is strictly prohibited and devalues the degree that you are working on. As a member of the NJIT community, it is your responsibility to protect your educational investment by knowing and following the academic code of integrity policy that is found at: http://www5.njit.edu/policies/sites/policies/files/academic-integrity-code.pdf.   

Please note that it is my professional obligation and responsibility to report any academic misconduct to the Dean of Students Office. Any student found in violation of the code by cheating, plagiarizing or using any online software inappropriately will result in disciplinary action. This may include a failing grade of F, and/or suspension or dismissal from the university. If you have any questions about the code of Academic Integrity, please contact the Dean of Students Office at dos@njit.edu

### Disability accommodations
Students with disabilities who may need disability-related accommodations for this course are encouraged to make an appointment to speak with Dare Brawley at the start of the semester. A Letter of Accommodation Eligibility from the Office of Accessibility Resources & Services (OARS) authorizing your accommodations will be required. Chantonette Lyles, Associate Director OARS (oars@njit.edu or 973-596-5417) is the point of contact for this letter, please reach out to discuss your specific needs.  

### Device policy
During scheduled class time students will be expected to use their computers only to access course-related materials (Webex meeting, tutorial resources, class syllabus, readings, QGIS). 

The online format of this course means that minimizing/resisting external distractions from non-class related computing (social media usage, email, other work, online shopping etc) is challenging but a shared responsibility of all members of the class. For more on computation and attention please see Tim Wu's [*Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to get Inside our Heads*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/234876/the-attention-merchants-by-tim-wu/)

## Resources

### Office hours
Office hours will be held via Webex by appointment on Thursday 5-6pm and Friday 10-11am. Please email dare.a.brawley@njit.edu at least 24 hours in advance to set up an appointment.

### Software

Geographic Information Systems is not a software. As such this course will not seek to provide students with proficiency in a particular software platform. 

Tutorial resources will be primarily provided for QGIS 3.10. This is an open source software program for geographic analysis that runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. All students will be expected to download and install QGIS 3.10. Documentation for QGIS is available [here](https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/index.html), and a training manual with good basic tutorials is available [here](https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/training_manual/).

ESRI ArcGIS Pro is another software tool for work with geographic information systems. This is a proprietary software available to you via remote desktop to NJIT computer labs. Suggested tutorials in ArcGIS [published by ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/resources) will be made available throughout the semester in connection with relevant course topics. Students are encouraged to develop familiarity with ArcGIS Pro. 

Knowledge of design and layout programs (Adobe Illustrator, and InDesign) will be expected and required for the completion of multiple assignments. 

#### Remote access
Policies for remote software access and software that is available to download are available here: 
- [List](https://ist.njit.edu/software-available-download) of software available for download
- [Instructions](https://ist.njit.edu/software-available-labs) to access computer labs remotely
    - note: for access to Weston 140 computers, at step 2 in the above instructions ("Click here: NJIT's Remote Student Computer Lab Access portal") use the following URL for the HCAD lab portal to use the Weston 140 workstations: https://remoteaccess.labstats.com/new-jersey-institute-of-technology-hcad

### Email policy
Students should not rely on or expect an immediate response to questions sent via email to the instructor. Please begin assignments with enough time to attend office hours or ask a question several days before the assignment is due.

Learning how to troubleshoot technical issues and locate relevant resources is crucial in your long-term success with GIS methods. With this in mind emails with technical questions must at a minimum contain the following: 
- a clear description of what you are trying to do, and what the problem is 
- a summary of the steps you have already taken to address the issue
- screenshots (where applicable) that help to explain the problem 
- a link to at least one website you consulted for assistance with the issue before writing the email. The [QGIS docs](https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/index.html) are are good starting place as is [GIS Stack Exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/).
