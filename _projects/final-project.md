# Final project 

For your final project you will develop a research project that uses mapping to support or research some aspect of [Newark Forward: A blueprint for Equitable Growth and Opportunity in Newark](https://www.newarknj.gov/news/newark-forward-report). Students are encouraged to focus in particular on the plan’s consideration of Housing, Environmental Sustainability, and Inclusive Development. You may also propose a topic related to another current planning effort or current event in the City of Newark that is of interest to you, pending instructor approval.  

Broadly, you will devise a project of your own interest that may either be research-focused (answering a specific spatial research question for which the answer is not known) or narrative-driven (using a specific spatial question as the basis for telling a story about a place/set of conditions to a particular audience). The process and deadlines for both options will be the same, but students will either produce a research-report or a narrative atlas as their final deliverable depending on which approach they chose. Topics that can serve as possible starting points include:  

- Environmental Sustainability  
    -  What Newark neighborhoods have the least access to green spaces? the most access?  (Research report format)
    -  Identify and advocate for the conversion of multiple vacant properties into open space.   (Narrative atlas format)

- Housing 
    -  What are the spatial patterns of vacant properties in Newark? (Research report format)

- Inclusive Development
    -  Develop a typology of Newark’s corridors to guide the selection of priority sites for investment. (Narrative atlas format)

The project will require students to develop a proposal, design a methodology, and produce final outputs (taking the form of either a narrative atlas or a graphic research report). Final presentations will be held at the end of the semester. 

Students may work alone or in pairs -- or groups of three with instructor permission.

## Schedule

**November 4**, topic proposal due  
**November 11**, methodology due  
**November 18**, revised methodology, design precedents + preliminary maps due  
**November 25** [No class (Friday classes meet on this day)](https://www5.njit.edu/registrar/fall-2020-academic-calendar/)  Please use this week to develop your projects 
**December 2** near-final maps due
**December 9** Final Presentations  


## Formats and Outputs

### Final Presentation
All students will be asked to give a 5 minute presentation to the class on **December 9th** following a structured format, adapted from the [PechaKucha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha) style of presentations. All presentations must be:  

- 5 minutes long
- use 10 slides with original GIS-produced drawings (these can be thematic maps, and/or graphs resulting from GIS-based analysis)
- each slide should be designed as an image (in other words you must include appropriate map titles, legends, annotations but should not include bullet points or other descriptive text)
- may use an optional 11th slide for an establishing photograph or non-GIS based visual media

Slides should be 1920x1080 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio).

### Final report or atlas

The ten original GIS-based drawings that you will produce for your presentation will serve as the basis for a final document compiling your work either as a 'research report' or a 'narrative atlas'. In both cases you will produce a designed PDF which combines the drawings produced for your slides with enough analytic text to make your argument or research clear. 

The exact content will vary depending on your project (research project or narrative atlas) but all projects must include: 

- Introduction
- Methodology description + diagram (see examples in [assignment 03](/../assignment03))
- Thematic maps depicting your research from your final presentation slides
- Conclusion 

Final reports/atlases must be uploaded to Canvas as a single designed PDF.

## Topic proposal

**Please submit the following on Canvas by class time on 11/4** 

Review the Newark Forward plan and its recommendations. Get familiar with the topics covered and the specific recommendations. Begin to think through: what topics from the plan are most interesting to you? where do topic and/or recommendations overlap with previous projects you've done? Either thematically or in terms of the area of Newark that they cover? Do you want to produce a research project or a narrative atlas? 

Decide on a preliminary topic and write up a proposal that has the following sections: 

- General explanation of research topic (1-2 paragraphs)
- Preliminary spatial research question (more info about this on 10/28)
- Statement about whether you would like the final form of your project to be a research report, or a narrative atlas
- List of datasets that you think you will need to use, identify which ones you already have (with links) and which you might need help to find
- Bibliography with at least three sources aside from the Newark Forward plan relevant to your chosen topic. 



## Precedents

Below are a selection of examples for graphic, methodological, and narrative approaches. 

### Narrative atlas

["Time Is Running Out to Save the Last of the World’s Rainforest"](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-the-last-of-the-rainforest/) September 13, 2020. Bloomberg.  

- This is an example of a narrative-driven mapping project which also has a strong graphic approach. It is an online-format report with animations beyond the scope of what is needed for this assignment. However still offers a helpful framing and graphic style.


[Fleming, Billy. 2019. “The 2100 Project: An Atlas for the Green New Deal | The McHarg Center.” The McHarg Center.](https://mcharg.upenn.edu/2100-project-atlas-green-new-deal) 

- This project covers topics and datasets related to themes from the Green New Deal. It is less strong on a clear narrative, however serves as a perhaps helpful starting point for those interested in topics related to environmental concerns. 

### Research report

[Shelton, Taylor. “Rethinking the RECAP: Mapping the Relational Geographies of Concentrated Poverty and Affluence in Lexington, Kentucky.” 2018.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14RvglnIXTxb4mPIcZmOzp09E-uRNHWwV) 

- The article length format doesn't apply here, however Shelton's analysis is a great example of a specific spatial research question. 

[Graziani, Terra, Joel Montano, Ananya Roy, and Pamela Stephens. 2020. Who Profits from Crisis? Housing Grabs in Time of Recovery.](https://challengeinequality.luskin.ucla.edu/2020/10/16/who-profits-from-crisis/)  

- This is a great example of a GIS and analysis driven but policy focused research report on the spatial impact of investor purchases of housing in times of crisis.
