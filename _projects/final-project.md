# Final project 
For your final project you will develop a research project that uses mapping project that supports or researches some aspect of  [Newark Forward: A blueprint for Equitable Growth and Opportunity in Newark](https://www.newarknj.gov/news/newark-forward-report). Students will be asked to focus in particular on the plan’s consideration of Housing, Environmental Sustainability, and Inclusive Development. A detailed assignment will be distributed midway through the semester. 

Broadly, students will devise a project of their own interest that may either be research-focused (answering a specific spatial research question for which the answer is not known) or narrative-driven (telling a story about a place/set of conditions to a particular audience). A list of topics will be distributed that can serve as possible starting points, and might include:  

- Environmental Sustainability  
    -  What Newark neighborhoods have the least access to green spaces?
    -  Identify and advocate for the conversion of multiple vacant properties into open space   

- Housing 
    -  What are the spatial patterns of vacant properties in Newark?

- Inclusive Development
    -  Develop a typology of Newark’s corridors to guide the selection of priority sites for investment

The project will require students to develop a proposal, design a methodology, and produce final outputs (taking the form of either a narrative atlas or a graphic research report). Final presentations will be held at the end of the semester.
