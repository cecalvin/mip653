# Final project 
For your final project you will develop a research project that uses mapping to supports or researches some aspect of [Newark Forward: A blueprint for Equitable Growth and Opportunity in Newark](https://www.newarknj.gov/news/newark-forward-r  eport) or another current planning effort or current event in the City of Newark that is of interest to you.Students are encouraged to focus in particular on the plan’s consideration of Housing, Environmental Sustainability, and Inclusive Development. 

Broadly, you will devise a project of your own interest that may either be research-focused (answering a specific spatial research question for which the answer is not known) or narrative-driven (telling a story about a place/set of conditions to a particular audience informed by a specific spatial question). A list of topics will be distributed that can serve as possible starting points, and might include:  

- Environmental Sustainability  
    -  What Newark neighborhoods have the least access to green spaces?
    -  Identify and advocate for the conversion of multiple vacant properties into open space   

- Housing 
    -  What are the spatial patterns of vacant properties in Newark?

- Inclusive Development
    -  Develop a typology of Newark’s corridors to guide the selection of priority sites for investment

The project will require students to develop a proposal, design a methodology, and produce final outputs (taking the form of either a narrative atlas or a graphic research report). Final presentations will be held at the end of the semester. 

## Topic proposal

Review the Newark Forward plan and its recommendations. Get familiar with the topics covered and the specific recommendations. Begin to think through: what topics from the plan are most interesting to you? where do topic and/or recommendations overlap with previous projects you've done? Either thematically or in terms of the area of Newark that they cover? Do you want to produce a research project or a narrative atlas? 

Decide on a preliminary topic and write up a proposal that has the following sections: 

- General explanation of research topic (1 paragraph)
- Preliminary spatial research question (more info about this on 10/28)
- Statement about whether you would like the final form of your project to be a research report, or a narrative atlas
- List of datasets that you think you will need to use, identify which ones you already have (with links) and which you might need help to find
