## Map example guidelines

Each week 1-3 people will share a map that interests them with the class. Below are guidelines for these **brief** presentations and a few starting points for places to look for examples. 

By **Tuesday at 10pm** on the week you have [signed up for](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mVdNMDSJeg_5xG_5u6sseNZboA8FTMkofijmNq3ejdE/edit#gid=0) please upload an image or link to a map (or atlas) that you wish to discuss with the class to the [precedents_examples](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hX2L_SnID3kmbzYb_J2RyfdftPhpK49T) folder. Please follow these naming conventions exactly:  `20200909_lastname_firstname_title` where the date is the date of the class you will be presenting. 

Map example you choose might:
-  be related to current events; 
- depict a topic in a manner that you find interesting/surprising; 
- use a cartographic style you find compelling; 
- present a historical issue or map style you haven't seen before; 
- or might describe a particular place in a way that makes to see that location differently. 

Please be prepared to share your screen during class in order to (1) show the map you have selected, (2) describe its origins and share why you chose it with the class.  Presentations should be (no longer than 4 minutes). 

The examples presented over the course of the semester will contribute to a shared class resources of visual and thematic precedents.
