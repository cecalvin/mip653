# Final project

For a full assignment description please see [this page](../final-project/)

## Precedents for graphic, methodological, and narrative approaches

### Narrative atlas

["Time Is Running Out to Save the Last of the World’s Rainforest"](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-the-last-of-the-rainforest/) September 13, 2020. Bloomberg.  

- This is an example of a narrative-driven mapping project which also has a strong graphic approach. It is an online-format report with animations beyond the scope of what is needed for this assignment. However still offers a helpful framing and graphic style.

[Badger, Emily, and Quoctrung Bui. 2019. “Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A House With a Yard on Every Lot (Published 2019).” The New York Times, June 18, 2019, sec. The Upshot.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html)
- Study of zoning across multiple cities in the U.S. 


[Fleming, Billy. 2019. “The 2100 Project: An Atlas for the Green New Deal” The McHarg Center.](https://mcharg.upenn.edu/2100-project-atlas-green-new-deal)  

- This project covers topics and datasets related to themes from the Green New Deal. It is less strong on a clear narrative, however serves as a perhaps helpful starting point for those interested in topics related to environmental concerns.  

[Scape Studio. 2011. *Gateway: Visions for an Urban National Park*.](https://www.scapestudio.com/projects/gateway-visions-urban-national-park/)

- This project uses maps and data to make a series of arguments for a vision for a new kind of park in NYC.  

[Scape. 2010. *Safari 7*.](https://www.scapestudio.com/projects/981/)

- This project asks viewers to view the areas along the 7 train in NYC through an entirely different perspective.

[Galen Pardee. 2020. *The Great Lakes*. [Exhibition]](https://www.archpaper.com/2020/09/the-great-lakes-architectural-expedition-at-osu/). See also this [description](https://drawingagency.org/The-Great-Lakes-Architectural-Expedition) and [this article](https://www.mascontext.com/observations/the-great-lakes-architectural-expedition/)

- outside the scope of the final assignment for this class, but this project shows how a narrative atlas can serve as the starting point for exhibitions and other wide ranging formats. 

[Grga Basic. 2014. *Joules of the Arctic*](http://grgabasic.com/project/joules-of-the-arctic/)

- This project uses animation (not directly applicable to the formats for the final project) to narrate the transformations of the Arctic.


### Research report

[Shelton, Taylor. “Rethinking the RECAP: Mapping the Relational Geographies of Concentrated Poverty and Affluence in Lexington, Kentucky.” 2018.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14RvglnIXTxb4mPIcZmOzp09E-uRNHWwV) 

- The article length format doesn't apply here, however Shelton's analysis is a great example of a project that addresses a specific spatial research question 

[Graziani, Terra, Joel Montano, Ananya Roy, and Pamela Stephens. 2020. Who Profits from Crisis? Housing Grabs in Time of Recovery.](https://challengeinequality.luskin.ucla.edu/2020/10/16/who-profits-from-crisis/)  

- This is a great example of a GIS and analysis driven but policy focused research report on the spatial impact of investor purchases of housing in times of crisis.  
 
[Ellis Calvin, Robert Freudenberg, Sarabrent McCoy. 2019. "The New Shoreline." Regional Plan Association](https://rpa.org/work/reports/the-new-shoreline)

- see section 5 "Planning for Wetland Pathways" to for analysis of wetlands taking a multi pronged approach

[Baics, Gergely, and Leah Meisterlin. “Zoning Before Zoning: Land Use and Density in Mid-Nineteenth-Century New York City.”  2016.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14j9vgeBbiz4uGutd_ZhQrKDAttqsN53p)

- The sections here on density or on spatial organization of land uses in 19th century NYC are each a great example of a spatial research project. The design of maps is also a really strong graphic example.
