This brief tutorial will outline how to download data from the U.S. Census Bureau for use in a GIS software. 

This process involves two main steps:
1.  extracting tabular data (spreadsheet) for the specific variables, survey, and year you are interested in 
2. joining this data to the appropriate census boundary files 

## Accessing census tables
